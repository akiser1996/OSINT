A curated list of Opensource Threat Intelligence resources for cybersecurity

A concise definition of Threat Intelligence: *evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and actionable advice, about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets that can be used to inform decisions regarding the subjectâ€™s response to that menace or hazard*.

## File Analysis

Most of the resources listed below provide lists and/or APIs to obtain (hopefully) up-to-date information with regards to threats.
Some consider these sources as threat intelligence, opinions differ however.
A certain amount of (domain- or business-specific) analysis is necessary to create true threat intelligence.
